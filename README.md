# Valheim - Silence Tame Wolf Cub Howls Mod

**_Works with Mistlands Update!_**

This is inspired by [Keezys_Better_Wolves mod](https://github.com/marqgray/valheim-better-wolves), and tweaks the approach to allow hunting with tamed wolves without the loss of enemy wolf howls.

### Problem

* Both adult and young enemy wolves will howl constantly whenever they're in earshot.
* Adult tame wolves will not howl, but their young offspring will.
* Breeding tame wolves shouldn't come at the cost of peace and quiet.

### Solution

* This mod will only silence howls if there are young _tame_ wolves within 30 meters.
* This allows exploring/hunting beyond the homestead without changing enemy wolf behavior.

While tame wolves won't attack one of their own, they're handy companions in most exploring/hunting situations. So having them present shouldn't also silence enemy wolves.
